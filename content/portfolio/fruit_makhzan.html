<h5>Description</h5>
<p>
  A database-themed shop-management game.
  <br />
  Players interact with an artistically presented database of fruit items, and
  make decisions about selling prices and when to restock. Fruit sales are
  controlled by in-game factors like 'weather' and 'politics'. Day-by-day
  spending and sales performance are displayed graphically. The player unlocks
  new fruits at different levels of achievement, and is given the opportunity to
  create their own fruits to add to the database.
  <br />
  I chose to learn another coding language - PHP - due to its high utility in
  interacting with MySQL databases. I studied the powerful JavaScript library
  jQuery to keep the display tight, stylish, and concisely coded. I explored an
  Object-Oriented-Programming approach as well as Functional Programming to
  determine the best way of organising the flow of data.

<h5>Challenges</h5>
<p>
  In the initial phases, a really enjoyable challenge was setting up PHP on my
  machine, as the process of creating an Apache server was very different how I
  had used JavaScript and Python. With what I had learned from previous projects
  about hosting, I prioritised creating the simplest possible proof-of-concept
  version, and then fully hosting it externally, before continuing any actual
  game development. This let me iron out this unfamiliar new way of creating a
  server while the project was still in its simple stages.
  <br />
  In the later phases, another challenge was the speed required for optimal
  gameplay. Tapping the spacebar moves the game forward by one 'day'. The player
  is likely to hold down spacebar to breeze quickly through a dozen days a
  second. Each new day involves modifying the database. When hosting the
  database externally, this gameplay style was made too slow. I used optimistic
  rendering to fix this, which I had learned about on the Northcoders coding
  bootcamp, in order to keep gameplay fluid while keeping the database up to
  date.

<h5>What I learned</h5>
<p>
  I really enjoyed working with Cookies and Sessions. A key feature was for the
  player to continue a game where they left off, even if they reopen the webpage
  weeks later. Deciding which variables to store in Session and which to store
  in the external database, and the specific ways in which these should interact
  and update each other was key. I really enjoyed getting very familiar with
  this aspect, for which PHP was shown to be a powerful tool.
  <br />
  It was fun to further develop my SQL knowledge and database skills. I
  researched extra features like JSON support, and I compared different database
  management systems such as MariaDB and ClearDB to get the best balance between
  features and hosting. I learned Prepared Statements and used these along with
  the sanitising functions of PHP to adhere to best practices.
