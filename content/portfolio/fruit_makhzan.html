<h5>Description</h5>
<p>
  A database-themed shop-management game.
  <br />
  <br />
  Players interact with an artistically presented database of fruit items, and
  make decisions about selling prices and when to restock. Fruit sales are
  controlled by in-game factors like 'weather' and 'politics'. Day-by-day
  spending and sales are displayed graphically. The player can create their own
  fruits to add to the database.
  <br />
  <br />
  I chose to learn another coding language - PHP - for its high utility in
  interacting with MySQL databases. I taught myself the powerful JavaScript
  library jQuery to keep the display tight, stylish, and concisely coded. I
  explored Object Oriented as well as Functional programming approaches to
  determine how best to organise the flow of data.

<h5>Challenges</h5>
<p>
  A really enjoyable challenge was setting up a PHP devlopment environment, as
  the process of creating an Apache server was very different to how I had
  previously used local hosts in JavaScript and Python. Taking forward lessons
  from previous projects, I prioritised creating the simplest possible
  proof-of-concept version in the early stages, fully hosting it externally
  before continuing any actual game development.
  <br />
  <br />
  A later challenge was the speed required for optimal gameplay. Tapping
  spacebar moves the game foward a 'day'. The player can hold down spacebar to
  breeze quickly through 'weeks' per second. Each new 'day' involves database
  modification. When hosting externally, this was made too slow. I refactored
  the project to use optimistic rendering, which I had learned about on
  Northcoders, a multi-award-winning fullstack developer bootcamp, to keep
  gameplay fluid and the database updated.

<h5>What I learned</h5>
<p>
  I really enjoyed working with Cookies and Sessions. I wanted the player to be
  able to continue where they left off, even weeks later. It was crucial to
  precisely decide which variables to store in Session and which in the external
  database - and the specific ways these should interact and update each other.
  I really enjoyed this aspect, for which PHP was a powerful tool.
  <br />
  <br />
  It was fun to further develop my SQL knowledge and database skills. I
  researched extra features like JSON support, and compared different database
  management systems, such as MariaDB and ClearDB, for the best balance of
  features and hosting. I used Prepared Statements and the sanitising functions
  of PHP to adhere to best practices.
