  I took this opportunity to learn a new language - Python - and a new frontend
  framework - Angular. I chose Python for being a widely used languages in data
  science, with an extensive range of modules and libraries for this purpose.
</p>
<h5>Challenges</h5>
<p>
  The first was the wonderful puzzle of determining the most time-efficient
  method for crunching millions of data permutations. I experimented with 'for
  loops', 'recursion', and 'yield', finally rewriting the backend from scratch
  to use a Python module called 'itertools'. The finished app switches
  dynamically between two itertoools methods, which my testing revealed to yield
  the fastest response times.

  I wanted the user to receive results in real-time, not wait a set interval
  then receive them all at once. After many setbacks and spikes, the easier path
  was clearly to just accept the less optimal user experience, but through
  determined research and testing I succeeded in creating a RESTful backend
  server delivering real-time results, via Flask (a web framework used by
  Pinterest and LinkedIn) and Flask-SocketIO.

<h5>What I learned</h5>
<p>
  I really enjoyed learning Angular and using a project structure different from
  React. As a first impression, Angular seemed more fiddly to connect up
  Components, Services, and Modules, though I see how this has more expandable
  modularity, suggesting that Angular is better suited to heavyweight
  applications than are React and Vue.
