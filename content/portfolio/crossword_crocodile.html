<h5>Description</h5>
<p>
  A custom crossword maker. Enter your word into an elegant and verdant
  interface, and millions of calculations will check against a word bank of
  thousands to create complete crossword grids to your specifications.
  <br />
  I took this opportunity to learn a new programming language - Python - and a
  new frontend framework - Angular. I chose Python for being one of the most
  widely used languages in data science, as well as further diversification of
  my coding knowledge. Its extensive range of modules and libraries would also
  come in useful.

<h5>Challenges</h5>
<p>
  The first was the wonderful puzzle of the most time-efficient method for the
  app to crunch millions of permutations. I experimented with varied approaches,
  based around 'for loops', 'recursion', and 'yield'. I finally rewrote the
  backend from scratch to use a Python module called 'itertools', and made the
  app switch dynamically between two itertoools methods ('permutations' and
  'product'), which my testing revealed to ultimately yield the fastest response
  times.

  I wanted the user to receive results in real-time, instead of waiting a set
  interval then receiving them all at once. After many setbacks and spikes, it
  was certain that the easier path was to just accept the less optimal user
  experience, but through determined research and testing, I succeeded in
  creating a RESTful backend server that would deliver real-time results, which
  I accomplished with Flask (a web framework used by sites such as Pinterest and
  LinkedIn) and Flask-SocketIO.

<h5>What I learned</h5>
<p>
  I really enjoyed learning Angular and working within a different project
  structure to what I was familiar with in React. As a first impression, it
  seems more fiddly in Angular to connect up the Components, Services, and
  Modules, though I see how this has more expandable modularity with regard to
  different people working on different sections of the project, suggesting that
  Angular is better suited to heavyweight applications than are React and Vue.
