<h5>Description</h5>
<p>
  A clean and simple Single Page Application for rapidly sorting a list of items
  into "yes" and "no". The design aims to be clear and unfussy while packing in
  as much utility as possible.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The user can upload a list by pasting it directly, and also by uploading a
    text file, with selectable options for how to separate words.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user can sort their list by clicking buttons and also with customisable
    keyboard shortcuts. Sorted items can be moved between lists at any time.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user can download and also clipboard-copy the contents of either list at
    any time.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user can undo their actions, all the way back to the beginning if they
    wish, and the list can be restarted or randomised. Google results for the
    current word can be opened in a new tab.
  </li>
</ul>
<br />

<h5>Challenges</h5>
<p>
  My key aim was to fit in as much functionality and customisability as
  possible. In preparation for another project I personally sorted thousands of
  words as an end-user with SortCut, so I had much opportunity to think of extra
  functionality that would make it a more powerful tool, such as customisable
  keyboard shortcuts, copying to clipboard, and input tools.
  <br />
  <br />
  The challenge this raised was that many features were to be implemented after
  the initial planning phase and once most of the project was already underway,
  which meant several focused periods of reworking the data flow and overhauling
  the project structure so that the right data and functions would be available
  where needed.
</p>
<h5>What I learned</h5>
<p>
  The importance of data management, and useful planning techniques to take
  forward. It was fun to further explore React and to learn more about useful
  interfaces such as KeyboardEvent, which I used to allow the user to set their
  own keyboard shortcuts, as well as working with Blobs to allow the user to
  upload and download lists.
