<h5>Description</h5>
<p>
  A clean and unfussy Single Page Application for rapidly sorting lists into
  "yes" and "no".
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The user can paste a list directly, or upload a text file, with selectable
    options for separating items.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user can sort by clicking buttons, or with customisable keyboard
    shortcuts.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user can download, or clipboard-copy, the contents of each list at any
    time.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user can undo, even back to the beginning. The list can be restarted or
    randomised, and Google results for the current word open in a new tab.
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Challenges</h5>
<p>
  My key aim was to include as much functionality and customisability as
  possible. I personally sorted thousands of words as an end-user with SortCut,
  so I had ample opportunity to note down extra functionality to make a more
  powerful tool, such as customisable keyboard shortcuts and input tools.
  <br />
  <br />
  This meant that many features were to be implemented after the initial
  planning phase, once the project was already in development, requiring
  intensively reworking the data flow and overhauling the project structure so
  the right data and functions would be available where needed.
</p>
<h5>What I learned</h5>
<p>
  The importance of data management, and useful planning techniques to take
  forward. It was fun to further explore React and learn useful interfaces such
  as KeyboardEvent, which I used for customisable keyboard shortcuts, as well as
  working with Blobs to allow the user to upload and download lists.
