<h5>Description</h5>
<p>
  Chattercat is a chatroom website which allows you to create rooms,
  password-protect them, invite others players via a unique URL, eject players
  as the room boss, transfer role of room boss, and award stars to players. It
  handles this effectively using Socket.IO, managing multiple player
  interactions responsively.
  <br />
  <br />
  It is intended as a jumping-off-point for creating online games. Players can
  create and join rooms, and award stars which can be adapted into a points
  system for the game in question.

<br />
<h5>Challenges</h5>
<p>
  The various edge-cases that come with teams of players operating in different
  rooms required methodical work and detailed interactions to give the
  fully-rounded experience of private chatrooms.

<h5>What I learned</h5>
<p>
  This project was a good introduction to game-making and allowed me to extend
  and further implement my Socket.IO skills.
