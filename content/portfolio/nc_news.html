<h5>Description</h5>
<p>
  An online news aggregation forum where users can write and share articles as
  well as commenting and voting on each other's articles and comments. Have you
  used Reddit? It's Reddit.
  <br />
  <br />
  This project is a fullstack RESTful API, with a PSQL database where Knex was
  used as a query builder, and a Frontend of React and CSS Modules. It was a
  solo project during the last week of the Backend and Frontend blocks of the
  Northcoders coding bootcamp.
</p>
<h5>Challenges</h5>
<p>
  There many user stories, with each distinct route branching off into many more
  CRUD operations, between commenting, writing, voting, editing, and deleting
  articles and comments. While it could have felt overwhelming as my first solo
  project of this kind, I made sure to keep detailed and precise notes and
  diagrams of all the paths, how they connected, and which endpoints would be
  used. Taking the time to update my planning documents at every stage made the
  process enjoyable and productive, and I found the process of data management
  throughout the app especially enjoyable.

<h5>What I learned</h5>
<p>
  On the Frontend, I researched tools to improve project organisation, and
  decided on CSS Modules to separate out the different CSS styles for each
  section. Upon returning to this project many months later to improve it, I
  noticed that the use of CSS Modules had led to code that tended to repeat
  itself and was not very DRY, so I went through and implemented a global CSS
  module to improve concision.

  On the Backed, the importance of Test Driven Development was clear, and I
  really enjoyed meticulously sketching out every user story I could, and
  creating a specialised test for each unhappy path that a user could take. I
  took the initiative to create an extensive series of customised error messages
  to augment the existing HTTP response status codes (400, 404, etc), the aim of
  which was to make the later job of creating the frontend as smooth as
  possible, with clear and precise feedback to future devs (which in this case
  was myself). This ensured a clear division of tasks, and efficient workflow.
