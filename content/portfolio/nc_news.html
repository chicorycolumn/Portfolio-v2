<h5>Description</h5>
<p>
  An online news aggregation forum where users can write and share articles as
  well as comment and vote. Have you used Reddit? It's Reddit.
  <br />
  <br />
  A fullstack RESTful API, with a PSQL database where I used Knex as a query
  builder, with a React frontend and CSS Modules. This was a solo project during
  the last weeks of the Backend and Frontend blocks of Northcoders - a
  multi-award-winning fullstack developer coding bootcamp.
</p>
<h5>Challenges</h5>
<p>
  There were many user stories, with each distinct route branching off into many
  more CRUD operations, between commenting, writing, voting, editing, and
  deleting. While it could have felt overwhelming as my first solo project, I
  assiduously kept precise notes and diagrams of all paths and their connected
  endpoints. Taking the time to update my planning documents at every stage made
  the process enjoyable and productive. The task of data management throughout
  the app was especially enjoyable.

<h5>What I learned</h5>
<p>
  On the Frontend, I researched tools to improve project organisation, choosing
  CSS Modules to separate out styles by section. Upon returning many months
  later to improve this project, I noticed this had led to code that in some
  ways repeated itself and was not very DRY, so I refined it and implemented a
  global CSS module to improve concision.

  On the Backed, the importance of Test Driven Development was clear, and I
  really enjoyed meticulously sketching out every user story, creating a
  specialised test for each happy and unhappy path. I took the initiative to
  create my own series of customised error messages to augment the existing
  status codes (400, 404, etc), to facilitate the later job of creating the
  frontend, giving clear and precise feedback to future devs (in this case,
  myself). This ensured a clear division of tasks, and efficient workflow.
