<h5>Description</h5>
<p>
  An online two-player word game that uses webcam for facial recognition. Upon
  entering the lobby, players can pull faces to represent four different
  emotions, and the emotion recognition API uses the webcam to detect which
  emotion is being expressed, and takes a photo at the correct moment. These
  photos of the player's own face are transferred onto the 'word worm' - a 2D
  physics object that crawls around the screen - onto which the player drops
  Scrabble tiles to spell out words and beat their opponent.
  <br />
  <br />
  The game provides:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A login and lobby system to find other users online to play against, built
    with React
  </li>
  <li>An in-game chatroom , built with Socket.IO</li>
  <li>
    A webcam feature with facial and emotion recognition, built with a facial
    recognition API
  </li>
  <li>A 2D physics game, built with Phaser</li>
  <li>
    Realtime connections to allow both players to see each other's in-game
    action instantly, via a backend server using Express and Socket.IO
  </li>
  <li>
    Checking of valid words during gameplay, via the Oxford English Dictionary
    API
  </li>
</ul>

  This was the final project at Northcoders. It was thought of, designed,
  developed, and tested all within two weeks. The project started at the
  beginning of the Covid-19 UK lockdown in 2020, so the team of four
  collaborated entirely remotely.
</p>
<h5>Challenges</h5>
<p>
  This being our first original project with minimal guidance from tutors and
  great encouragement to learn and solve problems ourselves, we decided to be
  ambitious. In addition to learning Phaser - a 2D physics game engine - we
  decided to add webcam features and realtime facial recognition of emotions. I
  took the lead in this last part, and spent several weekends intensively
  spiking webcam features and API integration.
  <br />
  <br />
  Transferring the images taken by the camera into the Phaser-rendered canvas,
  as well as integrating the two frameworks (Phaser and React) required much
  dedicated work. I found that I really enjoy data management in projects,
  putting in the days needed to spike and develop ways to make data available
  both between the frameworks, as well as over the server to the other player.
</p>
<h5>What I learned</h5>
<p>
  The team collaboration was fully remote, and I really enjoyed the fast
  learning curve of teamwork tools and planning aids. We used Trello as a kanban
  board, had daily standup meetings, ultimately delivering an end-to-end app in
  an Agile environment. As teammates we made sure to keep each other fully
  updated about important developments, which gave us confidence to go off
  individually and put in the hard grind to develop specific features.
  <br />
  <br />
  We also learned the importance of testing the hosting early-on in the project,
  when integrating frameworks that we hadn't worked with before. While we ran
  into some issues, the game was ultimately launched with full functionality.
