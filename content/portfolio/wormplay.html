<h5>Description</h5>
<p>
  A Phaser-based online game with facial-recognition. Players create a username
  and enter a lobby, where they can pull funny faces in front of their webcam,
  and a emotion-recognition API takes photos of their face based on specific
  emotions. To play, users can join a game or create a new game room.

<h5>Challenges</h5>
<p>
  In game, players see their selfies appear on the worm's head, and try to drag
  and drop letters onto the worms to form words, against a timer. Socket.io
  allows players to play other users in real time, and the worms show different
  expressions based on game events.

<h5>What I learned</h5>
<p>
  This was the final two-week project at Northcoders, entirely remote working in
  a team of four to conceive, research, develop and deliver an end-to-end
  application in an agile environment. Used Trello as a kanban board and had
  daily standups. C Matus was primarily in charge of facial recognition
  components, and the data connections over the whole app.
