<h5>Description</h5>
<p>
  An online two-player word game with webcam facial recognition. Players can
  pull faces for different emotions, and the API detects which emotion is being
  expressed, and takes a photo at the correct moment. These photos display on
  the 'word worm' - a 2D physics object - onto which the player drops Scrabble
  tiles to spell out words and beat their opponent.

<ul>
  <li>Login and lobby system to find other users online, built with React</li>
  <li>In-game chatroom, built with Socket.IO</li>
  <li>
    Webcam feature with emotion detection, built with a facial recognition API
  </li>
  <li>2D physics game, built with Phaser</li>
  <li>
    Realtime connections to see each other's in-game actions instantly, via a
    backend server with Express and Socket.IO
  </li>
  <li>Checking of valid words via the Oxford English Dictionary API</li>

  This was the final project at Northcoders. It was thought of, designed,
  developed, and tested in two weeks. We started at the beginning of the
  Covid-19 2020 UK lockdown, so our team of four collaborated remotely.

<h5>Challenges</h5>
<p>
  As our first original project, with minimal guidance and great encouragement
  to learn and solve problems ourselves, we chose to be ambitious. In addition
  to learning Phaser - a 2D physics game engine - we added realtime facial
  recognition. I took the lead in this last part, spending several weekends
  intensively spiking webcam features and API integration.
  <br />
  <br />
  Transferring the webcam images into the Phaser-rendered canvas, as well as
  integrating Phaser with React, required extensive work. I really enjoy data
  management in projects, putting in the days needed to develop ways to make
  data available both between the frameworks, as well as over the server to the
  other player.

<br />
<h5>What I learned</h5>
<p>
  I really enjoyed the fast learning curve of teamwork tools and planning aids
  in this fully remote collaboration. We used Trello as a kanban board, had
  daily standup meetings, delivering an end-to-end app in an Agile environment.
  As teammates we kept each other fully updated about important developments,
  which gave us confidence to go off individually and put in the hard grind to
  develop specific features.
  <br />
  <br />
  We learned the importance of testing the hosting early-on when integrating
  unfamiliar frameworks. While we ran into some issues, the game was ultimately
  launched with full functionality.
