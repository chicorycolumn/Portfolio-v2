<h5>Description</h5>
<p>A stylish and responsive personal portfolio website.</p>
<h5>Challenges</h5>
<p>
  I researched design ideas and looked through other portfolio websites vaunted
  for their style and simplicity. I investigated different frontend frameworks
  and decided to learn Bootstrap, a highly popular CSS library. The main qualm
  from my research was that Bootstrap-based websites can end up looking very
  similar, so I aimed to customise and embellish as much as possible.

<h5>What I learned</h5>
<p>
  It was fun to learn a new library, as well as customising and creating my own
  Bootstrap-style classes. I realised I hadn't made my previous projects
  mobile-first, so I went back and changed this. Additionally, I decided I
  wanted to know the detail of what Bootstrap is doing behind the scenes, so I
  refreshed my CSS knowledge and filled in any gaps by studying some full-length
  CSS tutorials.
  <br />
  This was a new and interesting change from CSS Modules, and it was fun
  exploring a different way of writing tight and concise code when sharing CSS
  styles across a project.
