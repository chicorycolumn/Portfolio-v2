<h5>Description</h5>
<p>A stylish and responsive personal portfolio website.</p>
<br />
<h5>Challenges</h5>
<p>
  I researched design ideas and other portfolio websites vaunted for their style
  and simplicity for inspiration. I surveyed frontend frameworks and decided to
  learn Bootstrap, a highly popular CSS library. My research suggested that
  Bootstrap-based websites can sometimes look similar, so I aimed to extensively
  customise and embellish.

<h5>What I learned</h5>
<p>
  It was fun to learn a new library, as well as customising and creating my own
  Bootstrap-style classes. I realised I hadn't made my previous projects
  mobile-first, so I went back and changed this. I wanted to know the detail of
  what Bootstrap was doing behind the scenes, so I refreshed my CSS knowledge by
  studying full-length CSS tutorials.
  <br />
  <br />
  This was a new and interesting change from CSS Modules, and I enjoyed
  exploring a different way of writing tight and concise code when sharing
  styles across a project.
