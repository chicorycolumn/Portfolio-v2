  Back in 2019 my love for puzzles had me making cryptic crosswords. I searched
  for data-crunching tools to level-up, but found none to my satisfaction.
  Having adored the Symbol Logic electives on my Philosophy degree, I decided to
  teach myself coding to build a crossword maker.

  This later led me to Northcoders, an award-winning three month fullstack
  JavaScript course. I enjoyed the keen focus on pair-programming, teamwork,
  plus encouragement of individual initiative. Our final project used daily
  standups, kanban boards, and an Agile environment. Since graduating I've been
  eagerly teaching myself new languages to build fun new things.
