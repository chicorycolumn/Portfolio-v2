<p class="cardProse">
  I started coding in 2019, when I began churning out cryptic crosswords (I've
  always loved puzzles) like there was no tomorrow. I searched online for the
  perfect tool to crunch the data, and not finding any to my satisfaction I
  started teaching myself how to code.
  <br />
  <br />
  This led to me to the multi-award-winning Northcoders bootcamp, a three month
  fullstack developer course. I especially enjoyed the keen focus on
  pair-programming, teamwork, communication, as well as encouragement of
  individual initiative. Our final project was built in two weeks in an Agile
  environment with daily standups and extensive kanban boards. Northcoders is a
  JavaScript course, and I eagerly taught myself new languages after graduating,
  such as Python and PHP.

<h2 class="cardHeading">Strengths</h2>
<p class="cardProse">
  An avid fan of puzzles and languages, I have the drive and dedication required
  to spend however long it takes to unravel a problem, as well as the natural
  programmer flair of asking "Is there a smarter way to solve this?". I have a
  natural talent for languages, communication, and creativity.

<h2 class="cardHeading">Work</h2>
<p class="cardProse">
  I've been an EFL teacher (English as a foreign language) for seven years.
  Languages are my passion, and I genuinely enjoy the process of teaching and
  communicating new concepts in different ways for different types of learner,
  helping people make new connections in novel ways about something I myself
  find so exciting.
