<p class="cardProse">
  I teach English, speak Spanish, and I'm learning Polish. I produce podcasts
  with Audacity. I perform theatre and comedy, further developing my
  communication and presentation skills. I've directed/produced shows in
  Edinburgh and Madrid: organising finances, rehearsals, venues, as well as
  doing graphic design and audiovisual.

<p class="cardProse">
  I studied Philosophy at the University of Liverpool (1st). My dissertation was
  on the computational theory of mind - if we should understand consciousness
  analagously to a computer.
