<h2 class="cardHeading">Languages</h2>
<p class="cardProse">
  I teach English, speak Spanish, and am learning Polish. I've learned a small
  amount of vocabulary in German, Italian, and Russian, as I love stitching
  together the connections between languages in the Indo-European family.

<h2 class="cardHeading">Creation</h2>
<p class="cardProse">
  I extensively use the Audacity audio editor to produce podcasts. I perform
  theatre and comedy, further developing my communication and presentation
  skills. I have directed and produced shows at the Edinburgh Festival and in
  Madrid, organising finances, rehearsals, booking venues and accommodation,
  plus graphic design and audiovisual work.

<h2 class="cardHeading">Education</h2>
<p class="cardProse">
  My Bachelor's Degree was Philosophy, and my dissertation was on the
  computational theory of mind - the question of whether we should understand
  consciousness as operating analagously to a computer.
